  Welcome to the Networking Packet Traces Repository! This collection of Wireshark packet traces is a valuable resource for students and networking enthusiasts seeking to understand network protocols, troubleshoot issues, and deepen their knowledge of computer networking.

## üìÇ What's Inside

This repository contains a wide variety of captured packet traces during different scenarios, including:

- **Computer Network Book** Most of the packets are captured from the exercises of the Book "Computer Networking - A Top-Down Approach, 8th ed., J.F. Kurose and K.W. Ross"
- **Lab Exercises:** Packet captures from in-class activities and are also similar to the Book exercises.
- **Real-World Scenarios:** Packet traces from real network environments, providing insights into actual network traffic.
- **Common Protocols:** Examples illustrating common protocols like HTTP, TCP/IP, DNS, and more.
